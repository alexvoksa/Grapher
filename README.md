## Purity/Pressure predictor(old project name - Grapher)

This is my diplome project, that I've made for Bechelor's Degree Graduation in NRNU MEPHI </br></br>
This programm predicts helium purity and pressure in the nuclear fuel using classic </br> 
linear regression model. </br></br>
Also, this programm have a preprocessor, that divides incoming AFR from acoustic sensors</br>
into multiple parts and performs pre-computations using some scientific methods.</br>
</br>
<b>Warning! Size of data after preprocessing increases in multiple times. ~1-2 millions of different ranges</b></br></br>
After preprocessing and fitting in linear regression scientist/engineer can use DataFrame and choose </br>
necessery frequency range and perform visualisation, to figure which range fits best </br>
for his/her own fuel category. </br>
After that, we can predict pressure/purity in selected frequency range.</br></br>
